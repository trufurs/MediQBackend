# MediQ Backend

## Description

The MediQ Backend is a Node.js and Express-based application designed to manage and facilitate the online sale and distribution of medicines. It provides a comprehensive set of APIs for user authentication, store management, medicine inventory, order processing, and location-based services. The backend integrates with MongoDB for data storage and utilizes Mongoose for schema modeling. It also integrates with external APIs like OpenFDA to provide comprehensive medicine information.

## Features

*   **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user registration and login using JWT and bcrypt for password hashing. Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (admin, store-owner, customer).
*   **Store Management:** APIs for managing store information, including creation, retrieval, and updates.
*   **Medicine Management:** APIs for managing medicine information, including integration with external APIs like OpenFDA for comprehensive data.
*   **Inventory Management:** APIs for managing store inventory, including adding, updating, and deleting medicines.
*   **Order Management:** APIs for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting orders.
*   **Location-Based Services:** Geospatial queries to find nearby stores with specific medicines.
*   **Request Management:** APIs for store-owner requests and admin approval workflow.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Centralized error handling middleware for consistent error responses.

## Technologies Used

*   Node.js
*   Express
*   Mongoose
*   MongoDB
*   JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
*   bcrypt
*   cors
*   express-async-handler
*   axios

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd MediQBackend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    *   Add the following environment variables:

        ```
        PORT=3000 # Or any other port
        MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
        JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
        OPENFDA_API_KEY=<your-openfda-api-key> # Optional
        url=http://localhost:4000 # Replace with your frontend URL
        ```

        Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the server using nodemon, which automatically restarts the server on file changes.

## Models

The backend uses the following Mongoose models:

*   [`User`](models/user.js): Represents a user account.
*   [`Store`](models/store.js): Represents a store.
*   [`Address`](models/address.js): Represents a store address.
*   [`Medicine`](models/medicine.js): Represents a medicine.
*   [`Inventory`](models/inventory.js): Represents the inventory of a store.
*   [`Order`](models/orders.js): Represents an order.
*   [`Request`](models/request.js): Represents a store request.

## Middleware

The backend uses the following middleware:

*   `authcheck`: Authenticates users using JWT.
*   `roles`: Authorizes users based on their role.
*   `errorHandler`: Handles errors and returns consistent error responses.
